# Project Description
A proposed AI computer vision technology aims to segment objects found on beaches, focusing on both natural and artificial litter. The project utilizes several segmentation algorithms, including Resnet50-Unet and YOLOv8 models. According to our experiments, YOLOv8x is identified as the most effective model for this task. [The dataset](https://www.seanoe.org/data/00743/85472/) used in the project is an open-source collection provided by Sugiyama, D., et al. (2022), consisting of 3500 images with corresponding masks and eight classes. A detailed explanation of this dataset can be found in the authors' journal article. Below are additional links related to the project.
